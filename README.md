How to run projects:

Firstly you must install Matplotlib to get the ability to dispaly the results.
To do this on mac run, 'pip3 install matplotlib' or on windows 'pip install matplotlib'
This ensures both of my projects run as they should.

and comment out the previous grid and agent set, then run.
