Project Overview:
Designed and implemented a Python-based solution to a multi-agent pathfinding problem, rerouting agents' paths to avoid collisions in advance. Tackled an optimization problem inspired by real-world robotics, where agents pick up and deliver items in a mapped environment. Implemented the Conflict-Based Search algorithm, a two-level method for multi-agent pathfinding, to solve the problem effectively. Overcame challenges in learning and applying new algorithms, strengthening my problem-solving abilities and enhancing my understanding of complex systems.

Installation Instructions:
Firstly, you must install Matplotlib to display the results.
To do this on macOS, run:
pip3 install matplotlib
Or on Windows, run:
pip install matplotlib
This ensures both of my projects run as they should.

Instructions on how to edit the grid and agent set in the main project python file (MAIN_PROJECT_Cbs_WithPickUpComplete):
There are swappable grid exmaples from lines 24 to 176. Simply uncomment the single grid and single agent set you want to test
and comment out the previous grid and agent set, then run.
